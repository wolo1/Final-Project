This is just a unfinished game demo and we would like to primarily show our main function including moving, turning, firing and basic scene of driver room.

It consists of 4 parts which are
test if Photon network works
test if the tank responses properly after we interact with it in the remote driver box
test if the movement and fire runs well
test if the skybox change correctly
Since at this moment we used the same button for firing and changing skybox, so you'll see the firing
and changing happen simultaneously
Later we will manage and set up a mapping without conflict

We would like to try all features that you listed in the form.
At least as much as we that can.

We haven't found a satisfied avatar model so for this moment we just use a cube for testing if we can see each other.

We haven't determined how should we drive and control the gun/cannon proper so for this moment we just use the traditional way, the htc vive/oculus button and trigger like our previous assignments did.

We would try to optimize the room setting more delicated and make more animation and everything as smooth as possible
