This is just a unfinished demo and we would like to mainly show our main function include move, trun, fire and basic scenario of driver room.

We would like to try all features that you listed in the form.
At least as much as we that can.
We haven't found a satisfied avatar model so for this moment we just use a cube for testing if we can see each other.

We haven't determined how should we drive and control the gun/connon proper so for this moment we just use the traditional way , the htc vive/oculus button and trigger like our previous assignments did.

We would try to optimize the room setting more delicated and make more animation and everything as smooth as possible
